# ECE 2112: Advanced Computer Programming and Algorithms 

## EXPERIMENT 4 - DATA WRANGLING AND DATA VISUALIZATION

### I. Intended Learning Outcomes :

1. To identify the codes and functions needed in cleaning and visualizing data
2. To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program that will be used in data wrangling and data visualization

### II. Instructions:

We were tasked to Download the ECE Board Exam 2 dataset found on this link: bit.ly/ECEBoardExamDataset
Afterwards, we wrote a Python script/code in the Jupyter Notebook to do the given problems. 


### ECE BOARD EXAM PROBLEM: 
Using data wrangling and data visualization technique with storytelling, analyze the data and present different
